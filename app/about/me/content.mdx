# What I Do

## CREATE FULL STACK WEB APPLICATIONS

I have experience building web applications with and without back-end integrations.

I am comfortable conceptualizing and organizing complex structures, and as such, my projects tend to be natural in their structure and easy to maintain.

## COLLABORATIVE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

I have consulted on small teams with:

- Dization, a Pittsburgh-based company developing an enterprise resource planning solution for small businesses
- Metazu Studio, a Nashville-based startup connecting clients with services in video production, AR/VR, social media, photography, and web design.

My work on these projects deals with managing the complexities of full-stack web engineering, as well as delivering beautiful user experiences to end customers.

## CREATIVE MINDED PROBLEM SOLVER

My background as a musician, composer, producer, and artistic collaborator provide me with a unique frame of reference for solving technical problems and adapting to dynamic environments.

## DATABASE OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT

My projects have featured both relational and non-relational databases, in particular PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I also have experience with various methods of connecting these to front-end applications.
