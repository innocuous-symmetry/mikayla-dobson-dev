# Mikayla Dobson | Software Engineer

Software design at the confluence of efficiency, ingenuity, and artistry.

## Why do you want me on your team?

Here are some things I've provided for my teams in the past:

### Connecting the dots

My strength lies in the big picture. My background as a composer of classical music has given me a lasting sense for how to assemble the pieces of a project into a cohesive whole.

As a software engineer, this means:

- I'm comfortable living in the world between the front-end and back-end
- I love solving emergent problems as a project's stack is expanding
